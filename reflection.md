### HTML

This first html notebook was a helpful way to practice implementing the html elements we learned in class. From a basic list to a complex table and form, I got to practice seeing how these elements display including nested elements and modified element properties in the case of the table implementation. The form and image exercises also showed the importance of behind the scenes implementation and not just looking at the page rendering by requiring the use of alternative text and label linking. This made the pages more accessible without changing their display.

### Accessibility

The second notebook on accessibility was an interesting exercise in making an accessible form. Wave immediately highlighted the many issues with missing labels and improper element usage. I first added properly linked labels for the text boxes and the radio buttons. I then grouped the radio buttons in a fieldset for accessibility and gave them the same name attribute to function as proper radio buttons. This fixed most of the Wave errors. However, I still had one for lacking navigation elements, which required me to add a main element to fix this. This shows the value of these tools in ensuring small things like navigation elements are not missed so that websites stay accessible.
