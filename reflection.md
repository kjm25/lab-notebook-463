## Reflection Document

### HTML

This first html notebook was a helpful way to practice implementing the html elements we learned in class. From a basic list to a complex table and form, I got to practice seeing how these elements display including nested elements and modified element properties in the case of the table implementation. The 03-table exercise felt especially helpful due to seeing these attributes. The form and image exercises also showed the importance of behind the scenes implementation and not just looking at the page rendering by requiring the use of alternative text and label linking. This made the pages more accessible without changing their display. I was able to do the excerises without first looking at the solutions.

### Accessibility

The second notebook on accessibility was an interesting exercise in making an accessible form. Wave immediately highlighted the many issues with missing labels and improper element usage. I first added properly linked labels for the text boxes and the radio buttons. I then grouped the radio buttons in a fieldset for accessibility and gave them the same name attribute to function as proper radio buttons. This fixed most of the Wave errors. However, I still had one for lacking navigation elements, which required me to add a main element to fix this. This shows the value of these tools in ensuring small things like navigation elements are not missed so that websites stay accessible. I was able to do this without first looking at the solutions.

## CSS

The CSS exercises were helpful to see in real time how the different css attributes, styles, and selections affected the page layout. However, I did have to look at the solutions first for some of these assignments. 05-position had several pixel values that seemed very hard to match without the solutions and 06-media-queries had several challenge positioning properties that I wasn't able to do with the just the lessons from class. The media selection also could have been explained better. I thought the selectors exercise was especially helpful as it is important to be able to pick out the correct elements to edit with css.

## Flexbox

The flexbox exercises were helpful to get practice with flexbox while seeing how the css changes affected the page in real time. I thought that most of the exercises were helpful, and the ones that required changing flow direction taught me something I did not understand well from class. I was mostly able to complete the exercises without the solutions. However, I did need to look for pixel heights on container 5 and for flow help on container 4. One thing I wish was explained better was the difference, if any, between using flex-flow and both flex-direction and flex-wrap.

## CSS-Grid

The CSS grid exercises were helpful to visually see how changes in the grid and the grid elements changed their layout. I thought that the grids 3 and 4 were especially helpful as I got experience changing the span of elements inside the grid. I was largely able to do the exercises on my own, but I did refer to the solutions for spacing and some exact divisions of fractional units as it was hard to tell from the screenshots. One additional concept that I think could have been covered is how reorder items in the grid like was done in the flexbox exercises.

## Bootstrap

The Bootstrap exercises were helpful in showing how to use this framework to easily do more complicated tasks like responsive formatting and pop ups. I thought that exercise 3 where we had to make a dynamic grid based on screen size was especially helpful as it was a new way to solve what seems like a very common problem. While the code examples in the slide gave a good starting point for most of the exercises, I struggled to fully complete these exercises without the solutions as it felt like there were simply Bootstrap classes used for formatting that I was not able to quickly find. One thing I wish had been explained better is why the Bootstrap grid is divided into 12 and the effects of not using a sum of 12 units.

## Javascript

The JavaScript exercises were an important way to help practice both parts of Javascript that were new to me and review for me. One exercise I thought was particularly helpful was the DOM exercise as I have never created elements in vanilla JS, which seems like an important skill to have. I was largely able to complete these without the solutions. However, the fetch exercise gave me trouble with looping through the fetched data and I had to see how the solutions processed the fetched data. One thing I wish had been explained better, is the reduce function as I needed to turn to online resources to better understand how the reduce problem could be solved.

## Questions From Canvas (For Reference Only)

Once you complete the lab exercises in one section (e.g. 01-HTML), you will
need to write some thoughts in the reflection.md document. The reflection notes
should include complete answers to the following questions:

Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?

How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?

Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s
topic a little better?
